          <h3>How much does a website cost?</h3>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>
              While we would love to be able to give a definitive, fixed price
              for a website, it really depends on the specific needs for each
              individual business. If one business needs a website comprised of
              five pages, while another has a substantially larger site of over
              100 pages - obviously those projects are going to command
              different price points.
            </p>

            <p>
              With that being said - here are some general guidelines on what to
              expect from a pricing standpoint.
            </p>

            <p>
              If you can get by with a small website (between 3 - 10 pages)
              using a pre-designed template, you can expect to pay approximately
              $2,500.00. A mid-sized website that has anywhere from 11 - 25
              pages, but still uses a pre-made template, will be between
              $3,000.00 - $5,000.00. If you have a lot of pages, are looking for
              something completely custom, or are looking for something that has
              special functionality such as eCommerce, custom calculators, or
              integrations with other services, you may be looking at anywhere
              from $10,000 - $20,000.
            </p>

            <p>
              Ultimately, the takeaway here is that we can accommodate projects
              of just about any budget - so long as expectations are set
              accordingly.

          <h3>Are there any monthly fees?</h3>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>
              This will vary depending on the type of project. For logo &
              branding projects, fees will be one-time costs. For website
              projects, we will typically charge a monthly fee, depending on the
              level of service you choose. To view a full list of our monthly
              packages, click here.

          <h3>How much does a logo cost?</h3>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>Logo projects typically cost between $3,000 - $5000.</p>
            <p>
              "Why so much?" many people ask. To answer simply - because they
              require a lot of work. At least, to do them properly. And of all
              of the investments that you will make for your business, your logo
              & branding is one area where you don't want to skimp.
            </p>

            <p>
              In business, image is everything. And while your overall brand is
              based on far more than just your logo, a bad logo can create a
              strong first impression (for better or for worse).
            </p>

            <p>
              A properly designed logo requires hours of research, and hundreds
              of sketches and iterations. And with an increasing number of
              branded businesses in the world, doing research to verify that
              your mark is unique is a tedious yet necessary part of the
              process.
            </p>

            <p>
              With each logo project that we complete, we provide 3 - 5 unique
              logo concepts, a branding guide that details how to properly use
              the logo, several versions of the logo that are print-ready, and
              can be sent to any printer or publisher for easy use, detailed
              color schemes, typography & associated fonts, and design samples
              of your new logo.

            What separates Right Creative from other top design agencies in the
            area?
          </h3>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>Experience, quality, and results.</p>
            <p>
              <strong>Experience.</strong> We have been designing websites
              professional since the early days of the web - before CSS was
              mainstream, and people still used tables for their website
              layouts. In the 20+ years that we have been doing this, we have
              work with and learned from many of the top voices in several
              industries. To put it simply - there are very few people in the
              world, let alone the area that can top our years of experience.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Quality</strong> At Right Creative, we hold an almost
              unrealistic standard for quality. We demand excellence in every
              project we take on, and firmly believe that the quality of our
              work demonstrates our commitment to these standards.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Results</strong> More than anything else, our focus is,
              and will always be getting results for clients. We don't care how
              pretty something is - if it is not resulting in the growth or
              obtaining of goals for our clients, then it is not time or money
              well spent. Our mission is to turn visitors into paying customers
              - and every decision that we make is rooted in that mission.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Other distinguishing features</strong> Some of the other
              things that separate Right Creative from other top-rated agencies
              are: we hand-code all of our websites for maximum results. We
              don't rely on Wordpress, plugins, templates or themes to
              accomplish things, and are therefore not locked in to the limits
              they pose.
            </p>

          <h3>We're just starting out. How can we afford your services?</h3>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>
              We started this business from scratch, and know full-well how
              tight money can be when you are first starting out. We empathize
              with the struggles of new business owners, and therefore work
              diligently so that the new businesses that we work with succeed.
            </p>

            <p>
              The primary criteria we look for when working with new businesses
              is the seriousness of the business owner. While it is natural for
              a new business owner to be cautious with the money they spend - we
              do look for a commitment to growth. If you do not have a specific
              plan for how you intend to grow your business, then the reality is
              - you will probably never be in a good position to afford our
              services.
            </p>

            <p>
              With that said - if you are growth-minded, then we are happy to
              help you achieve that growth, and are willing to work with you to
              come up with a plan that fits within your budget and comfort
              level. Whether this is a smaller site, financing options, or a
              payment plan - we are confident that we can figure out something
              that will be mutually beneficial.

          <h3>
            What is the difference between a pre-designed site and a custom
            site?
          </h3>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>
              The difference between pre-designed and custom sites is a lot like
              the difference between buying a home versus building a home.
            </p>

            <p>
              Pre-designed sites start with a website that has already been
              designed and coded. These sites will allow you to customize
              colors, fonts, photos, content, and your logo - but does not allow
              you to rearrange, reposition, or change the layout of the site.
              This option is great for newer businesses or businesses with a
              smaller budget. You not only get the benefit of a hand-coded,
              customized site, but you also benefit from a smaller price tag and
              faster turnaround time.
            </p>

            <p>
              Custom sites are built from scratch, exactly to your businesses
              needs. While custom sites often have a bigger price tag attached
              to them, they are also going to be more effective at converting
              your visitors into paying customers.
            </p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Can I make edits to my own website once it launches?</h3>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>
              Yes and no. With each client that we work with, we designate time
              to figure out what content clients will need to edit on a regular
              basis, and create tools to allow them to do that easily. For
              things such as news, articles, blogs, and portfolios, clients will
              have access to the Content Management System, and add/edit/delete
              those things as needed.
            </p>

            <p>
              For other areas of the site, we request that our clients trust us
              to make those edits, so to maintain the integrity of their
              website.
            </p>

            <p>
              It is very common for clients who have full control over their
              site to see it deteriorate after a while due to non-designers &
              non-developers adding content to the site using markup & styling
              that is not cohesive with the rest of the site. What results is a
              website filled with pages containing broken-looking content, and
              improperly formatted text.
            </p>

            <p>
              Because we care about the quality of our sites, the reputations of
              our clients, and the results that they see - we prefer to let our
              clients be the experts at what they do - and us to be the experts
              at what we do.
